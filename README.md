# Computer Vision for PowerPoint Slide Control

## Project Overview
This project aims to enhance the presentation experience by developing a computer vision program that allows for hands-free control of PowerPoint slides through hand gestures. By leveraging machine learning techniques and gesture recognition technology, this tool provides an innovative way to navigate slides seamlessly during presentations.

## Features
- **Gesture Recognition**: Detects and interprets hand gestures to control PowerPoint slides.
- **Real-time Processing**: Provides real-time feedback and slide control.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for smooth integration with PowerPoint.
- **Customization**: Allows for customization of gesture commands.

## Technologies Used
- **OpenCV**: For computer vision and image processing.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the machine learning models.
- **Mediapipe**: For hand tracking and gesture detection.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for development.
- **PyAutoGUI**: For simulating keyboard and mouse actions to control PowerPoint.
